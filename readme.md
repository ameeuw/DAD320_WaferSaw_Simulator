**DAD320 WaferSaw Simulator**

This is an editor and simulator for DAC programs written for the Disco DAD320 Wafersaw.
Cutting sequences that are taken from the DAD wafersaw can be imported, viewed and altered to be exported back. An interpreter for the cutting commands was written to visualize and verify the outcome of the program.

This software accompanies the works of my Bachelor's Thesis, written in 2012 entitled: "Characterization of the electro mechanical behavior of a piezoelectric transducer for a microdop generator". The context of the thesis is a piezo-electrically driven micro-droplet generator. The [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/ameeuw/DAD320_WaferSaw_Simulator/raw/master/2012_09_BT_Arne_Meeuw.pdf "Download thesis") is written in German language and can be found in the root of this repository.
